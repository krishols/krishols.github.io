<p>I have spent the summer of 2022 conducting research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the mentorship of Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi in the <a href="https://healthyml.org">HealthyML</a> group. We are continuing this research in the fall.</p>
<p>At UD, I am an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran&#39;s <a href="https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/">Computational Research and Programming Lab</a>. I contribute to the Exascale Computing Project&#39;s Scaling OpenMP With LLvm For Exascale (<a href="https://www.exascaleproject.org/research-project/sollve/">ECP SOLLVE</a>). Specifically, I write tests for the <a href="https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/ompvvsollve/">OpenMP Validation and Verification suite</a>. Most of the tests I write are in C, but I recently started learning Fortran to write some new tests! </p>

  <h2 class="category"> past</h2>
  <p>For the first three years of college, I researched computer science education under the mentorship of Dr. Austin Cory Bart. We recently <a href="https://doi-org.udel.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3478431.3499363">published our work at SIGCSE &#39;22</a> on the design process of an evidence-oriented classroom Python library. This Python package is called <a href="https://designer-edu.github.io/designer/">Designer</a>. Designer offers easy integration into computer science classrooms to teach Python through game and image development.</p>
<p>Along the way, I was also lucky enough to research in Dr. Valerie Earnshaw&#39;s <a href="https://earnshawlab.org/">Stigma Lab</a>, and with Dr. Debra Yarrington on accessible and educational technology. </p>
