 I am wrapping up my time as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology Summer Research Intern. I conducted research with Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi and Haoran Zhang on machine learning for health. My [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10OPA7wUJlZ4ur5rksZS5B1hKrSt0rUOi/view?usp=sharing) reports our results thus far. We will be continuing this work in the fall.
